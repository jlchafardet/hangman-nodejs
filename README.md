3. You have 6 attempts to guess the word correctly.
4. Enter your name to save your score if you win.

## Features
- Random word selection from a predefined list.
- Console-based user interface.
- Basic error handling for repeated guesses.
- **Leaderboard**: Top scores are saved and displayed from `hangman-nodejs_score.json`.

## Future Enhancements

### Initial Setup
1. **Basic Game Implementation**: 
   - Implement core game mechanics (word selection, letter guessing, win/loss conditions).
   - Use a predefined list of words.
   - Console-based user interface.

### Phase 1: Basic Enhancements
2. **Leaderboard**:
   - Store and display top scores in a JSON file.
   - Allow players to enter their names to save scores.

   - Provide clear feedback for repeated guesses.

### Phase 2: User Experience Improvements
4. **Enhanced Console Output**:
   - Improve the display of the word and guessed letters.
   - Add visual elements (e.g., hangman drawing) to represent remaining attempts.

5. **Difficulty Levels**:
   - Allow players to choose different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
   - Adjust word length and number of attempts based on difficulty.

### Phase 3: Game Optimization
6. **Optimized Word List**:
   - Load words from an external file or API.
   - Implement caching to avoid repeated loading.

7. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize game logic for efficiency.
   - Minimize redundant operations and improve data handling.

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
8. **Multiplayer Mode**:
   - Implement a mode where multiple players can take turns guessing.
   - Track scores for each player.

9. **Game Statistics**:
   - Track and display game statistics (e.g., total games played, win/loss ratio).
   - Store statistics in a JSON file.

### Phase 5: User Interface Enhancements
10. **Web Interface**:
    - Transition from console to a web-based interface using Node.js and Express.
    - Implement a simple front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
